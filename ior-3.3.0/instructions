The mdtest benchmark requires an MPI implementation, e.g. Open MPI or Intel
MPI.

To build mdtest, use the following instructions:

1. Load the MPI module file, e.g.

module load openmpi

2. export MPICC=mpicc
3. ./configure --prefix=$(pwd)
4. make
5. make install

The last command should install the executables in the bin/ directory. In
the bin/ directory, there are job scripts for 1 node, 2 nodes, ..., 32 nodes.
The job submission script allocates entire nodes so that other jobs are not
interfering with the benchmark.

The mdtest flags are shown in the job submission scripts.
