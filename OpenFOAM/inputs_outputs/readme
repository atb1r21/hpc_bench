This benchmark uses the HPC_motorbike example repository that is available on the web at the follwing location:
https://develop.openfoam.com/committees/hpc/-/tree/develop/HPC_motorbike
The repository provides the input data for three cases, small, medium and large. I have run the medium and large cases. 

For example, to run the Medium case with OF v10 I use the run scripts AllmeshM and Allrun in the following v8 location/directory:
https://develop.openfoam.com/committees/hpc/-/tree/develop/HPC_motorbike/Medium/v8

To run this case, a Slurm job script is added to the case directory (the following example is for 40 processors on one compute node)

#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=motorbike
#SBATCH --partition=scavenger
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=40
#SBATCH --time=2:00:00

source /home/hpc/benchmarks-2022/OpenFOAM/10/OpenFOAM-10/etc/bashrc
cd /home/hpc/benchmarks-2022/hpc-develop/HPC_motorbike/Medium/v8
time ./AllmeshM
time ./Allrun


As you can see, both scripts were run & timed:
AllmeshM -- Pre-processing
Allrun -- Computation
