This directory contains scaling directories (2, 4, 8, 16 nodes) of two GROMACS simulations

Each directory contains the .log output of the simulation, which contains all of the settings and commands from the start of the calculation

At the end of each .log file there is output data for how many nanoseconds per day each simulation ran for.

The simulations were ran using SLURM and using .sh files to submit the calculations, with specific .sh files for each directory.

PLEASE NOTE!!!!:

The benchPEP-h.tpr file is too large to be hosted on Github, the files for that .tpr are hosted at https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/benchPEP-h
