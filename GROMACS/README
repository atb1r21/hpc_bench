GROMACS Benchmark Information

GROMACS runs a stepwise MD simulation in these benchmarks regarding two seperate instances

We run it with the intel ONE API 2022 suite (2021 MPI as MPI development is lagging)

GROMACS produces results in nanoseconds per day, where more nanoseconds per day indicates that the simulation is going faster.

This application is an example of a large amount of the MPI CPU hours consumed on Iridis 5 and so has been included in this suite
