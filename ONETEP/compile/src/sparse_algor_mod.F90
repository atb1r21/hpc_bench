!   The module in this file was created by Nicholas Hine and Jolyon Aarons    !
!   in November 2017 based largely existing code from sparse_mod.F90, which   !
!   was variously written by Nicholas Hine, Peter Haynes, Jolyon Aarons and   !
!   others between 2004 and 2017.                                             !

!   Subsequent modifications and contributions by Nicholas Hine,              !
!   Jolyon Aarons, and others.                                                !
