2. Licence

2.1 This licence agreement ("Agreement") shall be effective 
from the Effective Date written above and is between CE and 
the USER. The Agreement requires that the USER has a permanent 
or tenured contract ("a Permanent-post Academic"), not a fixed
 term or temporary contract, or an independently funded research 
fellowship, at the INSTITUTION. If the USER ceases to be a 
Permanent-post Academic or an independently funded research fellow 
at the INSTITUTION, the Agreement will terminate immediately, 
subject to the provisions in Clause 2.4.

2.2 Under this Agreement CE agrees that, in consideration of 
payment of the Licence Fee by the USER or INSTITUTION, CE will 
provide and the USER will accept a nonexclusive and non-transferable 
licence for the use of the Software on the terms and conditions 
specified in this Agreement. The licence provided by this Agreement
extends to members of the USER's academic research group ("Group"), 
provided they are students or employees of the INSTITUTION. If any 
member of the Group ceases to be a student or employee of the 
INSTITUTION their licence to the Software will terminate immediately.

2.3 This Agreement allows the USER and Group to use the Software 
for their academic use and research needs only. Use of the Software, 
or any code which is a modification of, enhancement to, derived from 
or based upon the Software, for industrially funded research or for 
providing services to a non-academic third party is expressly 
prohibited, except in the case of a member of the Group carrying out 
research that is funded by a CASE studentship. The licence allows the 
Software to be used by the USER and the Group for collaboration with 
other research groups within the INSTITUTION and with research groups 
within other academic institutions.

2.4 In the event that the USER ceases to be a Permanent-post Academic 
or an independently funded research fellow at the INSTITUTION, CE will 
at their discretion and in consultation with the ODG offer individual
 members of the Group at their request written permission to continue 
using the Software under the licence provided in this Agreement. 
The continuation of the licence will be limited to the individual and 
the work specified in the written permission provided by CE. Upon 
completion or cessation of the specified work, this licence will 
terminate immediately.

2.5 This Agreement allows the Software to be used on an unlimited 
number of processors with no constraint on where these processors 
are located.


3. Publication

3.1 All published work; including journal and conference papers and 
theses; produced in part using the Software must the cite the paper 
"Introducing ONETEP: Linearscaling density functional simulations on 
parallel computers" C.-K. Skylaris, P. D. Haynes, A. A. Mostofi and 
M. C. Payne. J. Chem. Phys. 122, 084119 (2005)" along with any other 
relevant ONETEP references. The USER must be listed as the author or 
a co-author on this work.


4. Code Provision and Software Maintenance

in this Agreement no warranty, condition, undertaking or term, express

and terms are hereby excluded.

4.3 The USER will be solely responsible for the payment of any local, 
state, or federal use, excise, personal property, sales or other similar 
taxes or duties which may be imposed as a result of the transaction under 
this Agreement.

to the Software. The USER may not sublicense, distribute or copy (except 
for archival purposes) the Software or enhancements thereto.

5.2 This Agreement allows the USER or Group to produce additional 
functionality or code development for the Software ("Additional 
Functionality"). If this occurs, the USER shall inform CE promptly of 
such Additional Functionality. The USER shall and hereby does agree to

of such Additional Functionality to CE who shall have unrestricted rights 
to license such Additional Functionality solely for academic purposes. 
The USER shall give CE a right of first refusal to obtain an exclusive 
worldwide licence to distribute such Additional Functionality. The USER

CE. Aside from the foregoing, the USER and Group shall have no right to use 
(other than for their personal non-commercial use), market, sell, distribute 
or commercially exploit in any way any Additional Functionality for use 
with the Software, and may not refer to the Software in connection with any 
commercial use of Additional Functionality in any other software product 
without the prior express permission of CE.
