           ONETEP 6.0 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* The Hartree-Fock exchange (HFx) engine has been rewritten by Jacek
  Dziedzic. It is now massively parallel and scales well for large numbers 
  of OMP threads. With adequate resources (Ncores ~= Natoms) it is now 
  possible to run hybrid functional calculations for up to ~3000 atoms. 
  Smaller systems (<300 atoms) should see very impressive performance gains.
  The new approach is characterised by extremely good strong scaling and
  permits using many more CPU cores than atoms (Ncores ~= 10*Natoms).
  For more details see the updated documentation on www.onetep.org.

* The solvation model has been extended by Arihant Bhandari and Jacek
  Dziedzic to potentially include electrolyte, modeled as Boltzmann ions
  (Poisson-Boltzmann solvation). Ionic accessibility is defined using
  a solute density isosurface combined with radial cutoffs, which prevents
  the ions from reaching unphysically large concentrations close to the
  solute. A bespoke technique for keeping the total simulation cell
  charge-neutral in PBC has been implemented. Corresponding extensions to
  DL_MG have been implemented by Lucian Anton.
  For more details see the updated documentation on www.onetep.org.

* Speed boost to spectral function projection - should be significantly
  faster than previously
  
* Several bugfixes, i.a.: EDFT convergence, EDFT restarts, EDA, FOE, LPDOS,
  augmentation, hash tables, EMFT, RPA TDDFT, 1x1x1 PPDs, memory leaks.


           ONETEP 5.2 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* Embedded Mean Field Theory, Developed by Robert Charlton and Joe Prentice,
  allows for calculations with "embedded" subregions treated at a
  different level of theory from the surroundings.

* The code for the creation of the metric matrix in the spherical wave basis
  during a Hartree Fock calculation has been completely re-designed by
  James Womack so that rather than 3D numerical integrals, it performs 2D
  analytic, 1D numerical integrals. This should be much faster and much less
  resource-intensive, and removes one of the bottlenecks preventing
  widespread use of HFx-including functionals. The other, the poor-scaling
  of HFx comms, is currently being addressed by Jacek Dziedzic for
  inclusion in the next release. Distributed multipole analysis (DMA) 
  calculations will also benefit from the acceleration of metric matrix 
  evaluations.

* Partial Density of States functionality by Jolyon Aarons and Lucas Verga
  enables decomposition of eigenstates into their contributions from
  different sites, different types of orbital, etc. 

* Electron Localisation Descriptors: Rebecca Clements has implemented the
  Electron Localisation Function (ELF) and has also added experimental support
  for the Localised Orbital Locator (LOL).

* NEB Functionality has been completed, tested and made much more user-friendly
  by Kevin Duff.

* Improvements to Cutoff Coulomb in the slab geometry by Gabriel Bramley.

* Improvements to PAW forces, PAW+LR-TDDFT, treatment of core density in PAW,
  by Nicholas Hine.

* Improvements to Bandstructure Projection - more user-friendly.


           ONETEP 5.0 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* Ensemble DFT calculations now support non-fixed (free) spin, as well
  as general support for non-integer net spin and non-integer system
  charge in EDFT. See documentation on edft_spin_fix for more information.

* New implementation (not yet extensively validated) of Nudged Elastic
  Band transition state searching. Beads are calculated in image-parallel
  and will each produce their own ONETEP output files of the form
  onetep#.out, onetep#.dkn, etc. Calculation summaries will be written to
  stdout.

* Initial support for meta-GGA XC functionals. Two XC functionals (PKZB and
  B97M-rV) are available for use in energy, force, bandstructure etc 
  calcalations. This functionality is still under development and is not yet
  compatible with some other functionality (notably PAW and spin-polarization).
  Contact James C. Womack if you are interested in testing this new
  functionality.

* Initial support for full periodic boundary condition implicit solvation
  calculations. Again, this is still under development and has not been
  well-tested in combination with other functionality (notably PAW and forces).
  Contact James C. Womack if you are interested in testing this new
  functionality. 

* Major release upgrade for the packaged DL_MG multigrid library upgraded
  (to v2.0). This release features bug fixes, performance improvements and
  brings the high-order defect correction procedure into the library itself.
  This latest release of the DL_MG library is described in a recent publication
  in JCTC (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b01274). See http://www.dlmg.org
  for further details on the library. 

* Preconditioned Geometry Optimization: As a result of an eCSE-funded project
  to speed up geometry optimisation, we have made available new preconditioning
  code. See help file in documentation page, and input variables containing
  "precon", or contact Jolyon Aarons for more info.

* Dynamical Mean Field Theory calculations can now be performed, via a new
  interface with the TOSCAM package. (TOSCAM will be released imminently;
  contact Cedric Weber for more info on TOSCAM). See input variables containing
  "dmft" for more info, or contact Edward Linscott.

* Improvements to LR-TDDFT, including QNTO functionality by Jian-Hao Li.


           ONETEP 4.4 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* Core loss spectra, particularly Electron Energy Loss Spectra (EELS)
  but also XAS, may now be predicted as part of a conduction
  properties calculation. Set cond_calc_eels : T to obtain an
  elnes_bin file suitable for post-processing with OptaDOS to
  generate spectra.

* Numerous minor tweaks to make conduction NGWF optimisation and
  LR-TDDFT easier to use and more efficient: Automatic setup of
  number of conduction states (see documentation for cond_energy_range
  and cond_energy_gap). New easier-to-read output for LR-TDDFT.
  LR-TDDFT now compatible with PAW. Spin-polarised systems may be
  possible but are not yet well-tested so are locked by default -
  contact Tim Zuehlsdorff for more info if you want to try them.

* Angular momentum (and locally) projected density of states, including
  the calculation of band-centres and generation of OptaDOS input files.

* Experimental Fermi Operator Expansion (FOE) functionality, allowing
  for EDFT calculations without diagonalisation.

* Molecular dynamics improvements: The history of DKN/NGWFs (for
  extrapolation and propagation) is not local to a single calculation
  but can be saved and used for restarts. Hybrid extended Lagrangian/SCF
  (EL/SCF) and inertial (iEL/SCF) molecular dynamics propagation schemes
  are now available for the density kernel and for the NGWFs (latter
  still in development). The MD module now uses internal velocities
  instead of atomic velocities, meaning integration is more stable. 



           ONETEP 4.2 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* Major improvements to electronic transport functionality, including 
  eigenchannel decomposition and visualisation, an O(N) Green's function 
  method, greatly reduced memory requirements, and many optimisations and 
  improvements. This functionality now scales linearly with system size,
  and can be as large as 1,000s to 10,000s of atoms.

* Time-Dependent DFT without the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (ie full
  RPA TDDFT)

* New Preconditioner for PAW, accelerates convergence greatly

* Distributed Multipole Analysis

* Improvements to OpenMP Parallelisation

Technical Note:

* Reading/Writing of NGWF restart files now uses MPI-IO, which requires
  an MPI library supporting MPI-2.0 or above. Please contact the ODG
  if you have any problem with this functionality. It can be disabled
  by adding -DNOMPIIO to your config file.




           ONETEP 4.0 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* OpenMP Parallelisation greatly improved

* Time-Dependent DFT in the Linear-Response Formalism

* Many changes to solvation functionality including auto-solvation

* Extensive improvements to Hartree-Fock exchange calculations, enabling
  much faster hybrid functional calculations

* Projector Augmented Wave formalism completed (can now run with
  GGAs)

* Many other small additions of new functionality



           ONETEP 3.4 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* OpenMP Parallelisation: ONETEP is now a hybrid OpenMP/MPI code! Currently
  uses environment variables to determine thread count - this will change in
  future.

* New Multigrid functionality DL_MG, which is included by default
  in the build, allowing Implicit Solvent calculations at a relatively
  small extra computational cost compared to standard calculations!

* Van der Waals Density Functionals, as per the implementation by
  Roman-Perez and Soler (PRL 2009) of the method of Dion et al. Available
  flavours at present are: VDWDF, VDWDF2, VDWDFK, OPTPBE, OPTB88.

* Transport calculations, in the Greens Function formalism.

* Initial version of functionality for metallic systems with no bandgap.



           ONETEP 3.2 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* Calculation of Optical Spectra - works on top of a COND
  calculation to enable Kohn-Sham level treatment of optical
  properties

* Improvements to pseudoatomic solver - now able to automatically
  generate multiple-zeta + polarisation basis sets: eg try
  entering "DZP" in species_atomic_set and -1 in the field for
  the number of NGWFs in the species block

* Many improvements to MD functionality - new thermostates,
  extrapolation of density matrix, and much more

* Natural Bond Orbital population analysis. 

* Phonon calculation functionality, by finite displacements, plus
  calculation of thermodynamical quantities.

* Many improvements to Kernel DIIS.

* Improved parallelisation in sparse algebra and NGWF comms

* Numerous minor fixes, improvements, redesigns and other changes.


  NB: New default values of many input parameters: these will
  cause small (or sometimes not-so-small!) changes to the results of
  most simulations: please check carefully to see what has changed
  and try to ensure you are running with the same parameters before
  complaining that something is broken!



           ONETEP 3.0 Academic Release
           ===========================

New features:

* Conduction NGWF optimisation. Optimises a new set of NGWFs
  to describe the unoccupied (or 'conduction') states of a
  calculation. Set task 'COND' to activate, and see the
  help file in doc/conduction.tex for more information.

* Pseudoatomic Solver. Initialises NGWFs to the orbitals of
  the pseudoatom corresponding to the pseudopotential used,
  solved within the same sphere (and with the same cutoff
  energy). See doc/pseudoatomic_solver.tex for more details.

* New options for treatment of electrostatics: Implicit 
  solvation, real-space local pseudopotentials, improvements
  to Martyna-Tuckerman and Cutoff Coulomb.
  
* New optimisation methods - Kernel DIIS and NGWF DIIS: 
  Kernel DIIS minimises the energy with respect to the density
  kernel elements using Hamiltonian diagonalisation (this method
  ensures exact integer occupancies), while NGWF DIIS
  minimises the energy with respect to the NGWF coefficients.

* Updated DFT+U functionality: can now initialise to pseudoatomic
  orbital projectors (using any negative value of 'Z' in the
  block hubbard definition).

* Communications "groups" defined through comms_group_size to
  take advantage of shared-memory parallelism. Set this
  input variable to the size of a shared-memory unit to see
  improvements in the speed of sparse algebra and whole-cell
  operations.

* Many internal changes, redesigns, optimisations and
  extensions. For example, the whole-cell grid code can cope 
  with less than one slab per processor (ie some MPI processes 
  hold no slabs). This is best used in combination with 
  comms_group_size > 1 to ensure that such processes are not
  idle during whole-cell operations.

* Initial version of Projector Augmented Wave formalism -
  contact Nick Hine (ndmh3@cam.ac.uk) before attempting to 
  use this at present.
