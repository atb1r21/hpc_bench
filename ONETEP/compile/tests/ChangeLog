Change Log for ONETEP Quality Control Test Results

ndmh_2009_12_18: Added QC test results for Core i7 Processors, using new
                 ewald_mod.F90. Results with old ewald_mod.F90 match old QC
                 results for other architectures. Results for other
                 architectures should be tested similarly for consistency and
                 then updated as appropriate.

jd_2010_02_03: - Deleted test results for SUN (obsolete).
               - Deleted test results for OPTERON (duplicated by HECTOR).
               - Updated all test results for CORE2 with the ones generated
                 by the current ONETEP version, to reflect the minor changes
                 due to a bugfix in ppd_strategy.
               - Added results for test 16: martyna_tuckerman.out to CORE2.

ndmh_2010_02_19: - Added species_ldos_groups block to ethene_props.dat to make
                   it test the LDOS functionality
                 - Updated ethene_relax.out in COREi7 reference output, for
                   new geometry path, owing to changes in NGWF tightbox read
                   routines changing energies and forces for read-in tightboxes.
                 - Updated ethene_props.out in COREi7 reference output, for LDOS
                   output
                 - Updated xyz-periodic_silanes.out in COREi7 reference output,
                   due to fix in ppd_strategy_mod for FFTbox sizes.
                 - Added COREi7 output for Martyna-Tuckerman test (test16)

jd_2010_02_26: - Updated ethene_relax.out, ethene_props.out and
                 xyz-periodic_silanes.out in CORE2 reference output, for the
                 same reasons as above.
               - Updated all reference QC test results for HECTOR to reflect
                 recent changes.

ndmh_2010_03_25: - Updated CORE2_4procs and COREi7_4procs versions of
                   FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF.out and FeCO3_Ueq6.out because of fixes
                   to xc_mod in spin-polarised systems

jd_2010_05_05: - Added reference for test17 -- h2_noprojectors.out to test
                 the case where no projectors are used.

ndmh_2010_05_06: - Swapped out h2-noprojectors, swapped in hchain.out (to test
                   bandstructure as well as just no projectors) in CORE2
                   reference.

ndmh_2010_05_06: - Updated FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF and FeCO3_Ueq6 and C69N
                   reference outputs in CORE2 and COREi7 due to new
                   spin-polarised normalisation of kernel.

ndmh_2010_05_07: - Updated hchain.out in CORE2 and COREi7 reference outputs
                   due to realisation that old versions were causing a problem
                   with inconsistent overlap matrices.

ndmh_2010_05_18: - Updated Si8_cell5p38ang_ngwfs.out in CORE2 and COREi7
                   reference outputs due to fix for bugs in FFTbox==cell code.

ndmh_2010_05_18: - Updated hchain.out due to change in sign convention for
                   unfolded k-points.

jd_2010_09_01: - Updated CORE2_4procs version of h_bond_class_DEVEL to reflect
                 the fact that classical atoms are now included in the Ewald
                 calculation.
                 Corei7_4procs and HECTOR_4procs version still need updating.

cks_2010_09_27: - Updated CORE2_4procs version of h_bond_class_DEVEL to reflect
                  the fact that classical atoms are now represented as Gaussians.
                  Corei7_4procs and HECTOR_4procs version still need updating.

ndmh_2010_10_12: - Updated h_bond.out, h_bond_spd.out and
                   xyz-periodic_silanes.out in CORE2 reference outputs due to
                   change in FFTbox specification.
                   Due to a highly unfavourable minimum FFTbox size (67x67x67 -
                   ie all prime hence very slow), upped the energy cutoff of
                   ethane_relax to 750 eV so that the cell is 77x77x77 and the
                   FFTbox can be 75x75x75. Updated CORE2 reference to match new
                   input.

jd_2010_11_02: - Added QC-tests 21 and 22. Added reference outputs for these
                 for CORE2_4procs.

ndmh_2010_11_11: - Updated several out-of-date QC outputs in COREi7 directory.
                 - Added new results in COREi7 directory for tests 21 and 22.

ars_2010_11_23: - Added QC tests 26 and 27 plus references.

ars_2010_11_23: - Updated QC references CORE2_4procs (tests2,3,5,7,15),
    COREi7_4procs(tests2,3,5,7,8,10,11,14,15) and HECTOR_4procs
    (tests[1-17]).

jd_2010_12_16: - Updated QC references CORE2_4procs (tests 21, 22) with v2.9.2.8
                 to account for minor differences in output and different slab
                 assignment. Added QC reference 23 for CORE2_4procs.

ars_2011_01_17: - Updated references CORE2_4procs (test07,15,26),
                  COREi7_4procs(test07,11,15,26) and HECTOR_4procs(test15,26).
                  These changes come after the modification of electronic_lagrangian
                  for exact_lnv. Test11 had scaped from previous updates and has been
                  included in this update. Changed input file of test26 for newer
                  version of kernel_diis.

ndmh_2011_02_02: Updated QC reference COREi7 and CORE2 for tests 2 and 15 for
                 change to updating of matrices at end of loop ngwf_cg_mod

cks_2011_02_04:- Updated h_bond_class_DEVEL.out according to changes in electrostatic
                 embedding functionality. Currently updated only for Core2 platform -
                 needs to be updated for remaining QC test platforms.
                 Added new QC test h_bond_class_CC.dat which tests electrostatic
                 embedding within cutoff Coulomb.

ars_2011_02_15: Updated QC test27. Updated CORE2, COREi7 and HECTOR references
                for test26 and test27.

ndmh_2011_03_18: Updated h_bond_class_DEVEL.out in COREi7 directory consistent
                 with above change. Added h_bond_class_CC.out in COREi7
                 directory.

jd_2011_04_08: Updated reference for QC tests using the multigrid solver (21,22,23)
               for CORE2_4procs to account for the bugfix in the calculation of the
               residual, which is calculated correctly since v2.9.4.0. Energies were
               not affected to more than a 0.1 uHa/atom. References for remaining
               architectures remain to be updated.

ndmh_2011_05_03: Updated FeCO3_Ueq6.out and FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF.out in COREi7
                 directory to match changes to DFT+U forces in v2.9.5.0

jd_2011_05_20: Updated FeCO3_Ueq6.out and FeCO3_Ueq6_HUBBARDSCF.out in HECTOR and CORE2
               directory to match changes to DFT+U forces in v2.9.5.0

jd_2011_05_20: Added references for tests 18, 21, 22, 23 to HECTOR directory.

jd_2011_05_20: Updated reference for h_bond_class_DEVEL (cf. cks_2011_02_04) for
               HECTOR.

ndmh_2011_05_20: Updated, C69N.out, h_bond_class_CC.out, hchain.out,
                 ethene_props.out, GaAs_dimer.out, h_bond_class_DEVEL.out
                 due to new <QC> flags in properties_mod. Added
                 h_bond_class_CC.out in COREi7_4procs

ndmh_2011_05_20: Updated, C69N.out, hchain.out, ethene_props.out, and
                 GaAs_dimer.out due to new <QC> flags in properties_mod,
                 in CORE2_4procs

jd_2011_06_10: Updated openbc_multigrid (QC #23) reference for CORE2_4procs to
               take into account the change in threshold for charge coarse-graining
               and the rescaling procedure. References for other architectures need
               updating.

jd_2011_06_20: Updated openbc_multigrid reference for CORE2_4procs again to take
               into account further minor changes in charge coarse-graining. References
               for other architectures need updating. Updated h_bond_B3LYP (QC #9)
               reference for CORE2_4procs to reflect the fix in the VWN functional.
               References for other architectures need updating.

jd_2011_06_21: Added a new test (npa.dat, QC #29) along with a reference for CORE2_4procs.
               References for other architectures need to be added.

jd_2011_06_28: Updated martyna_tuckerman reference for CORE2_4procs to take into account
               improvements to the accuracy of the Martyna-Tuckerman approach. References
               for other architectures need updating.

ndmh_2011_07_18: Updated martyna_tuckerman, h_bond_B3LYP, GaAs_dimer and
                 h_bond_class_CC references for HECTOR_4procs due to recent
                 changes.

ndmh_2011_09_21: Added tests test19 and test20 (ethene_cond and hchain_cond) to
                 test "task: COND" functionality (conduction NGWF optimisation).
                 Both rely on the results of valence calculations (test06 and test17)
                 respectively, so need to be run after those have completed. They
                 use symbolic links to the .dkn and .tightbox_ngwf calculations
                 respectively.

ndmh_2011_09_21: Updated h_bond_class_CC .dat for fact that cutoff coulomb lengths
                 are now esdf "physical" inputs, rather than being hardwired
                 to bohr.

ndmh_2011_09_21: Updated martyna_tuckerman.out in COREi7_4procs directory.

jd_2011_09_27: Updated QC test #29 (npa.dat) and corresponding reference for CORE2_4procs.
               References for other architectures need to be added/updated.

                 Added reference file for test24 (ethene_phonon.dat) for COREi7

ars_2012_01_09: Added QC test #25 (ethanedieal.dat and ethanedial.sw_ngwfs) and reference
                for CORE2_4procs. This QC test aims to check the spherical waves expansion
                of the NGWFs.

ndmh_2012_01_26: Updated reference file for test19 for CORE2.

jd_2012_02_22: Updated reference file for QC test #09 (h_bond_B3LYP) for CORE2_4procs
               to take into account changes to Hartree-Fock exchange. References for
               other architectures need to be updated.

ars_2012_05_25: Updated QC test #25 (does not re-write sw_ngwfs file) and
                QC test #26 (adapted to new kernel_diis keywords). CORE2_4procs and
                corei7_4procs reference files updated.

ndmh_2012_07_27: Added QC test #30, to test VDW-DF functionality. Added reference
                 file for COREi7 for test #30.

ndmh_2012_07_27: Minor tweaks to input files for tests 4,8,10,11,12,17,19, to enable
                 change over to species_atomic_set: COND to go smoothly.

ndmh_2012_08_01: Due to the new default input parameters introduced in version 3.2,
                 every test output has been regenerated with the new defaults. The
                 exception is test08, where the input has been modified to
                 deliberately recreate the old defaults so as to demonstrate
                 continuity. So far, only COREi7_4proc results are present

ndmh_2012_08_01: Added CORE2 reference outputs to go with new QC ordering and
                 default input parameters.

jd_2012_08_13: Modified pyruvate_solvation QC test so that it converges properly
               with the new defaults. Regenerated references for QC-tests 26-28
               with the DCSE monogrid, for CORE2 and COREi7, but NOT for HECTOR.

ars_2012_08_23: Added QC test 29 for EDFT. Added reference file for CORE2 and
                Corei7, but not for HECTOR

                 match output of new fully self-consistent vdwDF.

ndmh_2012_11_06: Updated reference of test 20 (NPA) for COREi7 as it was previously
                 generated with an incorrect .dat file.

ars_2012_11_12: Updated input file for qc test 29 (EDFT). Updated reference files
                for CORE" and COREi7

jd_2012_11_19: Reworked the QC-test system: removed quantities that were not relevant
               and suffered from noise. Removed architecture dependence. Replaced all
               references with those obtained with version 3.3.3.0.

ndmh_2012_11_26: Replaced reference file for vdw-DF (test03) with new Self-Consistent
                 version.

                 test31/FeCO3_Ueq6_cDFT_atom_charge.dat to test CDFT functionality,
                 and associated reference outputs.

ars_2013_01_07: Updated output file reference Pt13.out.

ndmh_2013_05_07: Added "cond_maxit_lnv : 5 " and "cond_minit_lnv : 5" to
                 ethene_cond.dat to ensure equivalence to previous output.
                 Added ngwf_threshold_orig : 1.9e-6 to h_bond_spd.dat to
                 ensure it takes a well-defined number of NGWF CG steps
                 regardless of numerical noise.

ndmh_2013_06_06: Removed test17 due to its general flakiness. May be
                 reinstated later.

ndmh_2013_06_10: Committed updated versions for 3.4 of all QC outputs.
                 Checked for consistency with 3.3 outputs.

ndmh_2013_08_22: Committed new versions of all DFT+U and cDFT tests,
                 due to corrected forces in v3.5.2 (post-retreat)

ndmh_2013_09_02: Committed new test for HUBBARDSCF constrained DFT (test32)

jd_2013_09_02: Committed new reference for #19 (Martyna-Tuckerman) that also tests
               forces. Ensured that energy matches with old, removed reference to
               better than 1E-10 Ha.

jd_2013_09_24: Committed new reference fo #27 (openbc multigrid) that also tests
               forces. Ensured that energy matches with old, removed reference to

               Testcase is acetonitrile. Added reference.

jd_2014_06_05: Added QC test 45 (Distributed Multipole Analysis with spin-polarisation).
               Testcase is acetonitrile anion. Added reference.

ndmh_2014_07_03: Updated input for test 38 (C-chain.dat) due to changes to transport code.

jd_2014_07_09: - Added QC test 46 (Solvation with Boltzmann term).
               - Updated input for test 44 (DMA with no spin pol.) to indicate
          that it now uses electrostatic metric.
               - Updated input for test 45 (DMA with spin-polarisation) to use overlap metric,
          as default is now electrostatic metric (reference does not change).
        - Updated reference for QC test 25 (to reflect removed B88 sensitivity).
        - Updated reference for QC test 36 (to reflect removed B88 sensitivity).
        - Updated reference for QC test 43 (to reflect removed B88 sensitivity and
          the change in HFx overlap metric (twice expanded to once expanded)).
        - Updated reference for QC test 44 (to reflect updated input).

jd_2014_08_25: - All benchmarks regenerated by ndmh following a change to optimization logic by cks.
               - Benchmarks 25 and 43 (HFx) re-generated following a bug fix. The NGWF line search
                 was using stale expansion cache entries since v3.5.10.3 subtly affecting the
                 optimization.

jd_2014_09_25: - Re-generated benchmarks 44, 45 (DMA) to take into account additional QC output now produced.
                 Ensured previous QC output agreed for these two tests.

jd_2014_10_12: - Re-generated benchmark 46 (PBE solvation) to take into account changes in test case.
                 No defect correction is now performed and zero BCs are used.

jd_2014_11_03: - Changed QC test 46 input to reflect change in the keyword names. Reference unchanged.

ndmh_2014_11_05: All-new benchmark set due to change to FFTbox positioning
                 (tests 22,23,36 and 38 were failing, others had small
                 changes). benchmark.out.4.1.6

ndmh_2014_11_07: Update to ur_ur_bp_vdw-df2.dat so that it does not use BLYP and has a higher
                 cutoff energy, to avoid problems caused by very high-valued ringing of XC potential

jd_2014_11_09:   Disabled force calculation in QC test 46 (Boltzmann solvation), because PB forces
                 are not yet implemented. Updated benchmark to reflect that.

ja_2014_11_12: - Removed ldos_smear from test{7,20,35} and updated their benchmarks.
               - Added a test49, which tests the angular momentum projected DOS functionality against Pt3 - O.

ndmh_2014_12_18: Added COND and EELS calculations to test48, updated QC.

jd_2015_01_07: - Updated reference for QC test 46 (Boltzmann solvation) to take into account the
                 osmotic pressure, mobile charge, rearrangement entropy and accessibility correction
                 terms.

jd_2015_02_24: - Updated all QC tests using SWX (25, 43, 44, 45) to use new syntax.
               - Updated references for the above, for consistency, after checking they match old references.
               - Added QC test 50 to test DMA and HFx in combination + DMA charge scaling + DMA Bessel averaging.

ndmh_2015_03_10: Updated test35, the DDEC test, to match the new DDEC code by Louis Lee.

jd_2015_04_09: - Updated all QC tests using SWX (25, 43, 44, 45, 50) to use even newer syntax.
               - Added QC test 51 to test DMA for a subsystem.

ndmh_2015_04_16: Complete new benchmark set to go with release of 4.2.0, due to changes
                 to evaluation of non self-consistency forces.

jd_2015_07_08: New benchmark set to go with 4.3.1, due to changes in
               [1] handling cutoff_energy, when left unspecified,
               [2] MD engine (Ndof, internal velocities),
               [3] precision of Chebyshev interpolation,

                                         44 (f), 45 (f), 46 (f), 50 (f), 51 (w), where
                                         b - affected, but change below thresholds
                                         w - affected, to the point of warning,
                                         f - affected, to the point of failing.
               QC tests affected by [2]: None, as we don't currently test MD.
               QC tests affected by [3]: 25, 43, 44, 45, 50, 51. Only the last one started failing.

               All benchmarks have been regenerated, following a careful check that the changes are indeed
               related to the abovementioned changes.

jd_2015_08_28: Fixed flipped pseudos in QC 41, regenerated its benchmark. Verified that the retreat r1186
               gives the same result that devel did.

jd_2015_08_28: Regenerated benchmarks for QC 47 and 50, which changed due to the fix to the XC filter
               for spin-polarised systems.

jd_2015_09_21: Changed kernel cutoff radius in 23 and 24 to larger than twice the NGWF radius.
               Regenerated reference accordingly. Propagated to 4.3.2 by ndmh.

ndmh_2015_10_01: Regenerated output for 07/cond so that it prints the new QC outputs
                 for conduction occupancies. Also for 48.

ja_2015_11_05: Changed test49 to run with PAW and output local p-dos. Regenerated benchmark accordingly.

jd_2016_01_29: Updated benchmarks to test53 to be compiler-agnostic (using a reproducible PRNG).

jd_2016_02_15: Updated benchmarks to test53 to be compatible with zeroing the total momentum,
               which was accidentally lost during an earlier merge.

ndmh_2016_02_17: Updated benchmarks for test48,49 due to tweaks to PAW rhoij0 initialisation

ndmh_2016_02_25: Added a complete new benchmark set for version 4.4.0. Will delete
                 previous sets once this has been confirmed to be functioning
                 correctly. This removes issues of reformatted output etc.

ndmh_2016_03_17: Updated benchmark for test42 due to new cDFT group-projector forces update
                 by David O'Regan.

jd_2016_03_24: Added QC test 54 for EDA by Max Phipps.

jd_2016_04_05: Updates to QC test 54 to remove architecture dependence.

jd_2016_04_22: Trivial updates to QC tests 25, 43, 44, 45, 50, 51 to have them erase temporary files.

jd_2016_04_29: Regenerated benchmarks with 4.4.1 to include non-SCF forces that were missing
               in certain cases. Affected QC tests: 11, 12, 19, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34, 35, 39, 40, 42.

jd_2016_05_17: Regenerated benchmarks with 4.4.2 to take into account new PRNG for generating
               initial velocities in MD. Affected QC tests: 53 (both).

                 initialisation

ndmh_2016_06_29: Also regenerated benchmark for test49 due to same changes

jd_2016_07_22: (by Max Phipps) Diagonalisation-free EDA QC test added (#55).

jd_2016_08_15: Changed syntax in solvation QC tests (26, 28, 39, 40, 46) to follow new syntax.

jcw_2016_09_07: Added QC tests 56, 57 to test meta-GGAs.

                Added newest benchmark version 4.5.6.

jcw_2017_03_08: Regenerated benchmarks for test28 and test40 due to changes in
                formula for g_cut in evaluation of radial integral in openbc_locps.

jd_2017_06_28: Added QC #60 and #61 for polarisable embedding.

jd_2017_06_29: Updated reference for QC #51 (DMA on half-dimer, up to lmax=1) to reflect the
               fact that DMA no longer outputs zero quadrupoles when restricted to monopoles
               and dipoles. Verified that monopoles and dipoles match in the QC test.

jd_2017_08_31: Added QC #62 (espot output in the presence of PAW) on behalf of Jolyon Aarons.

jd_2017_09_05: Added QC #63 (implicit solvation with exclusion regions).

ndmh_2017_10_10: Regenerated benchmark for test07/tddft to reflect changes to initialisation
                 of P1 matrix.

ja_2017_11_27: Replaced QC #66 with a version without kernel sparsity - to avoid failures
               due to lack of precision.

ndmh_2018_02_07: Replaced QC #07 and #20 output due to fix to signs of NGWFs in version 4.5.15.9

ndmh_2018_02_08: Replaced QC #62 to get rid of max_slabs12 output which cannot work between
                 serial and parallel runs. Also cleaned up input file a bit.

ndmh_2018_05_30: Added new QC test in QC #28 - a PAW version of pyruvate_solvation.dat

ndmh_2018_05_30: Updated QC test inputs and outputs for #11, #12 and #31 to make new DMFT QC
                 test feasible. New DMFT QC test, QC #68.

jd_2018_06_11: Created a new set of benchmarks for 5.0.0 after veryfing they all agree with
               4.5.6.

jd_2018_08_24: Added QC #69: hybrid conduction.

jd_2018_10_09: Regenerated all benchmarks because the default FFT-box size changed (fix for
               bug reported by Alexander Perlov). The following QC-tests were failing after
               the change of default: QC #14, #15, #19, #22, #23, #24, #27, #34, #48, #51, #58.
               Bumped up version number to 5.1.2. Changed default version in userconfig to 5.1.2,
               changed version number in checkout script to 5.1.2.
               *** Note to users: if your calculation does not specify the FFT-box size manually,
                                  and your FFT box was smaller than the simulation cell,
                                  do not directly compare results obtained with v5.1.2+ with
                                  versions 5.1.1.x and older (because FFT-box sizes may differ).

jd_2018_11_25: Updated benchmark QC #69: hybrid conduction. Current version matches CASTEP.
               Added QC #70: hybrid conduction with spin polarisation.

ndmh_2019_01_24: Updated benchmark QC #28 pyruvate_solvation_paw due to fix to
	         bug in PAW initialisation

rc2013_2019_01_25: Added QC #72: embedded mean-field theory.

ndmh_2019_04_10: Added new QC test in QC #03 - benzene dimer with scissor
                 operator acting differently on the two monomers

ja_2019_05_18: Updated benchmark QC #28 pyruvate_solvation_paw due to fix to
	       bug in ngwf_cg - gradient needed to be recomputed before
	       entering forces_calculate.

jcw_2019_06_07: Updated benchmark QC #58 to use V-matrix generated with
         increased intervals and Chebyshev order in Chebyshev interpolation.
         With increased Chebyshev interpolation quality, the old (3Dc) and
         new (2Dn-1Da) V-matrix evaluation schemes exhibit better agreement.
         The crude settings used previously resulted in test failure due to
         slightly too large discrepancies in the QC outputs. The new benchmark
         was generated with the 3Dc scheme, but the test should run using the
         new default 2Dn-1Da scheme. This ensures that the new scheme is
         checked against the old scheme until this benchmark is replaced.

jcw_2019_06_07: Modified QC #44 to explicitly select 3Dc V-matrix evaluation
         scheme. This test uses 2nd order Chebyshev polynomials to evaluate
         V-matrix elements and the resulting atom-centred multipoles are
         very sensitive to the number of intervals in the piecewise
         Chebyshev expansion of SWs/SWpots (for both 3Dc and 2Dn-1Da schemes).
         This test has been retained as a way to check for regressions in the
         older 3Dc scheme, rather than changed to support the newer 2Dn-1Da
         scheme (which is now the default for evaluating the electrostatic
         metric matrix).

jcw_2019_06_13: Modified QC #50 and #59 to use higher quality (more intervals
         and higher-order polynomials) Chebyshev interpolation in evaluating
         the V-matrix. This is now practical with the new (2Dn-1Da) V-matrix
         evaluation scheme and much less expensive (memory and execution time)
         than using the old method with cruder settings. The atom-centered
         multipole moments output in the QC test are quite sensitive to the
         quality of Chebyshev interpolation in the old (3Dc) and new (2Dn-1Da)
         metric matrix evaluation schemes, but converge rapidly when the
         number of intervals/polynomial order are increased together.
         -
         Preliminary analysis of the convergence of atom-centred and total
         multipole moments with respect to Chebyshev interpolation quality
         indicates that (i) these reliably converge to limiting values
         (for 3Dc and 2Dn-1Da), and (ii) convergence is typically more rapid
         with 2Dn-1Da.  However, the 2Dn-1Da scheme is more sensitive (produces
         larger errors wrt the limiting value) for crude settings
         (e.g. Ni = No = 8).
         -
         The benchmarks for QC #50 and #59 have therefore been regenerated
         using the 2Dn-1Da scheme to evaluate the electrostatic metric matrix
         with higher quality of Chebyshev interpolation settings.

ndmh_2019_06_20: Regenerated benchmarks for QC #48, 49, 62 and 66
         to correspond to new PAW code for NLCC core density - slight changes
	 to energies and forces as a result.

jd_2019_07_12: Regenerated benchmark for QC #46 following a bugfix (charge
         convention for Boltzmann ions was flipped).

rjc_2019_07_18: Created QC #73 to test ELD functionality. Also test for spin
         polarisation.

gab_2019_07_20: Created QC #74 to test the functionality of the 2D Coulomb
	cut-off in terms of its electrostatic potential.

jd_2019_07_26: Modified inputs for QC #43 and QC #50 to not use swri-to-swex
               filtering, as the new HFx parallelisation scheme no longer
               supports it, and it's hardly necessary now that we have the
               2Dn-1Da scheme. Added new benchmarks.

jd_2019_08_25: Generated benchmarks for 5.2.0 using v5.2.0 RC7.
               These *do not* feature the change from 2019.07.26 because
               the official release did not include the new HFx.

jd_2019_09_04: Generated benchmarks for QC #43 and QC #50 as v5.3.1 to include
               the change from 2019.07.26.

jcw_2019_09_05: Created QC #75 to test the initial implementation of support
                for HFX in LR-TDDFT. This runs a LR-TDDFT(TDA) calculation with the
                B3LYP XC functional.

jd_2019_10_09: Created QC #76 and #77 to test Boltzmann solvation with the
               two-component electrolyte accessibility model -- in OBCs and PBCs.
               Updated QC #46 to reflect a change in Boltzmann solvation defaults.
               Generated new benchmarks for DMA tests to reflect a change in
               QC tags and elide printing out multipoles that are ~0.
               Tests affected: 44, 45, 50, 51, 59, 60, 61, 67.
               Adjusted jobconfig to only use relative tolerances for DMA multipoles.

rjc_2019_10_14: Modified QC #73 for 4 processors instead of 2

jd_2019_10_16: Updated benchmark for QC #77 to reflect changes in DL_MG.

jd_2019_11_03: Updated test QC #75 to choose a fixed number of 'occupied' states
           in hybrid LR-TDDFT.

jd_2019_11_20: Updated Boltzmann solvation QC tests:
               - QC #46 to use the new formulation for the steric potential,
               - QC #46 benchmark accordingly,
               - QC #76 benchmark to exclude the pure electrolyte term from the
                        grand energy functional to be consistent with the new
                        arrangement of energy terms,
               - QC #77 benchmark to take into account the new arrangement of
                        energy terms. This is now consistent with the use of a
                        chemical potential term and excluding the pure electrolyte
                        term.

jd_2019_11_25: Updated Boltzmann solvation QC test benchmarks:
               - QCs #46, #76 to use new output convention for chemical potential
                              and Boltzmann ion concentration and density.
                              Results did not change.
               - QC #77 as above and also to reflect changes in the definition of
                        bulk concentration (now referring to accessible volume).
                        This led to a change in results.

               Updated auto-solvation QC test benchmarks (#39, #40, #63, #65) to
               reflect the new format of free energy of solvation information
               printed out at the end of the calculation. Resuls did not change.

jd_2019_12_03: Updated Boltzmann solvation QC test benchmarks (#46, #76, #77) to
               reflect a tiny change in constants (CONC_0, CONC_MOL_PER_L_TO_AU).

jd_2019_12_09: Updated Boltzmann solvation QC tests (#46, #76, #77) to use new
               keyword for species-dependent accessibility. \Gamma removed from
               the pure electrolyte term -> benchmarks updated. New definition
               of electrostatic terms in PBCs (removal of rho_avg) affect energies
               for non-charge-neutral systems (this affects only the benchmark #77).
               Definition of \Gamma and volume still not consistent with DL_MG for OBCs.

jd_2019_12_11: Updated Boltzmann solvation reference #77 to reflect bugfix.

jd_2019_12_17: Updated QC test and reference for #76 -- the charge specified
               in the input was wrong. Updated reference for #65. Results
               did not change, but a warning has been added.

jd_2020_02_25: Updated input for QC #50 to increase the quality of the Bessel radial
               interpolation (introduced in v5.3.2.15). This ensures DMA multipoles
               are sufficiently accurate.

jd_2020_02_27: Renamed inputs in QC tests #76 and #77 to make filenames shorter and
               more descriptive. Updated benchmark for QC test #77 to take into
               a fix in DL_MG that ensures \int_V gamma(r) u(r) = 0. Added
               QC test #78 that tests solving PBE in PBCs with counterions in lieu
               of jellium.

jd_2020_03_03: Updated benchmark for QC test #77, effectively reverting the previous
               change, as it was done by mistake. The shifting is done properly
               now, previous version was a regression. Updated benchmark for #78
               to reflect that too. Added benchmark for #79 -- the 'smart jellium'
               model.

jd_2020_03_03: Updated benchmark for QC test #78 to take into account the shifting
               of the concentrations in the counterion model.

jd_2020_03_03: Updated benchmark for QC test #78 after fix to density shifting.

jd_2020_03_30: Updated benchmarks for Boltzmann solvation: #46, #76, #77, #78, #79.
               Results did not change, only added new QC tags.

jd_2020_04_16: Updated benchmark for Boltzmann solvation #79 (accessible jellium).
               Previous results incorrectly shifted the density in this case.
               Renamed Boltzmann solvation tests #76-#79 to better reflect what
               is being tested. Some keywords have been removed, some renamed,
               in Boltzmann solvation QC tests #46, #76-#79.
               Added QC test #80 (Boltzmann solvation with counterions_auto).

jd_2020_06_23: Generated a new set of references for v5.3.4. All results match
               previous benchmarks.

ndmh_2020_07_28: Added new QC test in test07 to cover RPA TDDFT (previously a gap)

ab_2020_09_09: Updated benchmarks for QC tests using EDFT #29, #47, #49, #62
               The expression for edft_ngwf_gradient has been changed from KHS_ to S_HK.

ndmh_2020_09_13: Added new QC test81 for spectral function projection.

jd_2020_09_15: Updated benchmark for QC test #66, which also uses EDFT.

ab_2020_09_16: Added a new QC test #82 for grand canonical edft.

ab_2020_11_06: Updated QC test #01 #02 #05 #06 #35 #36 #63 #67 #82 for VDW bug-fix.

jd_2020_11_21: Restored QC test #76 (input and benchmark), it somehow got erroneously
               replaced with QC #77 somewhere in v5.3.3.1.

gab_2020_11_30: Added QC test #83 to test pulay mixing EDFT.

gab_2020_12_01: Added QC test #84 to test soft sphere cavitation in the implicit
	        solvent model.

jd_2020_12_29: Added QC test #85 to test EDFT + auto solvation (requires reading
               of .vacuum_ham file).

jd_2021_01_28: Added 6.1.1 benchmarks for QC test #49 (EDFT) due to a slight change
               of result from bugfix (avoiding premature inner loop convergence).
               The EDFT convergence table also specifically denotes values as "/atom".

ja_2021_05_24: Added 6.1.2 benchmarks for QC tests #03 and #56 to test spin polarized
               versions of VDWDF and B97M-V (which includes VV10 nonlocal correlation).

gab_2021_05_26: Added QC test #86 to benchmark SAV for implicit solvent. Re-ran QC
	        tests for all implicit solvent tests for 6.1.3 to account for
	        new definition of the surface area in the apolar component of MPSM.

jd_2021_06_02: Updated benchmarks for #13, #58, #73, #75 to reflect the fact that
               more QC data is now printed (from the electrostatic potential
               functionality). Other results remain unchanged.

ja_2021_06_11: Added QC test #87 to test the OPTPBE functional. This also tests the
               VDWDF-style NLXC in the case of an odd number of electrons.

jd_2021_07_30: Corrected the number of NGWFs on F in #01, generated new benchmark
               (6.1.3). Corrected the number of conduction NGWFs on C in #07 
               (cond, rpa, tddft), generated new benchmarks (6.1.3 for cond,
               tddft, but not rpa as according to jobconfig is is not even run 
               currently).

ds_2021_09_30: Added QC test #88 to test WIRE cutoff coulomb, the test was made
               by taking the slab one #74 and modifying the type of cutoff.

jd_2022_01_23: Fixed issue #1878 (bad V_apolar NGWF correction term from solvation),
               which led to changes in benchmarks for #26, #39, #46. Removed one
               of the QC test inputs from #42, as it never had any benchmark and
               as such functioned as a no-op. It failed when run.

jd_2022_02_26: Updated reference for #87 (fix for issue #1888).

ab_2022_05_09: Added QC test #92 and #93 for DFTB. 

jd_2022_07_18: - Added QC #94 -- HFx in PBC. 
               - Added QC #95 -- HFx in OBC (and PBE0).
               - Updated reference for #59 due to changes in HFx BCs. 
                 Technically, all SWX/HFx references should be updated, as the 
                 tests now run in PBCs, but they were all isolated molecules,
                 where the BC change hardly matters -- except #59, where the 
                 multipoles were more sensitive.

ab_2022_07_26: QC test #2, #5, #35, #36, #63, #92, #93 updated for vdW bugfix.
               jd: The issue was broken vdW forces (too small by a factor of 2).
                   It has been introduced in v6.1.1.0 in 2020.11. Now diagnosted
                   and fixed by Arihant.
                   
jd_2022_08_17: Added new component to QC #28 (SCCS solvation). Updated [categories] in jobconfig.

jd_2022_09_19: Changed QC #94 (PBC HFx) to reflect the new necessary conditions
               for minimum box size. Updated benchmark accordingly.
               Switched QC #25, 43, 69, 70, 75 to explicitly use OBCs or else the new necessary
               condition would not hold. This makes sense, since these tests originally
               used OBCs in HFx. Now they consistently use OBCs everywhere through CC,
               except QC #75 where I left PBCs in and only switched HFx to OBCs.
               Some (#69, #70) benchmarks had to be updated, the remaining ones
               were left as is.

ab_2022_09_21: Updated QC tests for units compatibility.

jd_2022_09_28: Updated benchmarks from jd_2022_09_19 change for unit compatibility,
               because ab_2022_09_21 used previous inputs to regenerate his. All now in sync.
