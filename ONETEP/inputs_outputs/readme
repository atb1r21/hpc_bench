This directory contains the scaling directories (2, 4, 8, 16 nodes) for calculations from the University of Southampton's ONETEP codebase.

Each directory contains two test cases (testcase1 and testcase2) and the associated inputs and outputs, including a .sh script that submits it to SLURM

In the .out files in each testcase directory there are indications around the amount of time each calculation took.
